## About me

I integrate large amounts of multi-mission satellite remote sensing products and other geospatial data to produce actionable insights into how our planet is changing, for managing the natural resources that we need and protecting the places that we love. 

I recently joined the Research and Innovation Team at [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/) as a Data Scientist, focusing on satellite imagery and data fusion. More info on this new chapter to come soon. For now, I am excited to be joining the team and looking forward to apply my skills to help advance transparency of human activity at sea.

In 2024 I finished my PhD in Earth Science with the [Scripps Polar Center](https://polar.ucsd.edu/) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego (advised by Helen Fricker), where I was supported as a [Future Investigator in NASA Earth and Space Science](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/early-career-opportunities/).
My PhD research largely focuses on automatically detecting surface meltwater features on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and monitoring their water levels, which is crucial information for assessing ice sheet stability and building models that can confidently predict future sea-level rise. 

Prior to my PhD, I studied Engineering Physics with a focus on Data Science and Machine Learning at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/find-masters-programme/complex-adaptive-systems-msc/) and Mathematics/Economics at [Yale University](https://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/economics-mathematics/). 

In my spare time I enjoy connecting with people who share my love for the outdoors, often while hiking, backcountry skiing or rock climbing.
