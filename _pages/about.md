I integrate large amounts of multi-mission satellite remote sensing products and other geospatial data to produce actionable insights into how our planet is changing, for managing the natural resources that we need and protecting the places that we love. 

I am a PhD candidate in Earth Science with the [Scripps Polar Center](https://polar.ucsd.edu/) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego (advised by Helen Fricker) and a [Future Investigator in NASA Earth and Space Science](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/early-career-opportunities/).
My current work largely focuses on automatically detecting surface meltwater features on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and monitoring their water levels, which is crucial information for assessing ice sheet stability and building models that can confidently predict future sea-level rise. 

Prior to my PhD, I studied Engineering Physics with a focus on Data Science and Machine Learning at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/find-masters-programme/complex-adaptive-systems-msc/) and Mathematics/Economics at [Yale University](https://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/economics-mathematics/). 

In my spare time I enjoy connecting with people who share my love for the outdoors, often while hiking, backcountry skiing or rock climbing.
