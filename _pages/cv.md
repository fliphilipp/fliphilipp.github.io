Education
======
* Ph.D in Earth Sciences, University of California San Diego, 2024 (expected)
* M.S. in Engineering Physics, Chalmers University of Technology, 2018
* B.A. in Mathematics & Economics, Yale University, 2016

Work experience
======
* Sep 2018 - Present: Graduate Student Researcher / NASA Future Investigator
  * Scripps Institution of Oceanography, San Diego, CA, USA
  * Generated a data product of supraglacial melt lake depths from ICESat-2 satellite data across the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
  * Generated an inventory of satellite observations of through-ice-shelf lake drainages across Antarctica
  * Led a field campaign to ground validate spaceborne snowpack depth measurements from ICESat-2 in the Southern California mountains
  * Supervisor: Helen A. Fricker

* Jan 2017 - Jan 2018: Contracted Student Researcher
  * Fraunhofer-Chalmers Centre for Industrial Mathematics, Gothenburg, Sweden
  * I analyzed GPS tracking data for a large truck producer to gain insights into their customers' mobility patterns. This involved a global clustering of points where trucks stopped for extended periods of time, cross-referencing the resulting "hubs" with infrastructure data from open-source mapping platforms, and compiling results in a geospatial database in PostgreSQL/PostGIS for fast querying.
  * Supervisor: Mats Jirstrand

* Jun 2017 - Aug 2017: Visiting Assistant Researcher
  * Yale Graduate School of Arts & Sciences
  * I worked on an interdisciplinary project applying econometric methods to global weather station data to robustly estimate Earth's transient climate sensitivity from in-situ observational data. I also used machine learning algorithms for spatio-temporal interpolation of weather station records based on global reanalysis data.
  * Supervisors: Trude Storelvmo & Peter C. B. Phillips
 
* May 2015 - Aug 2015: Guest Researcher
  * Potsdam institute for Climate Impact Research, Potsdam, Germany
  * I carried out statistical data analyses focusing on the 'Great Acceleration' time series and related data sets. I found that many of these time series exhibit statistically significant break points around the 1950s. This means that it is possible to define the Anthropocene as a geological epoch with a stratigraphic marker that coincides with the "bomb spike" while also being rooted in a robust statistical analysis that takes into account the socioeconomic drivers characterizing the Anthropocene.
  * Supervisor: Jobst Heitzig
