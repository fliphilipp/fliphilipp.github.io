## Ski-based ground validation field campaign for ICESat-2 snowpack depth measurements in the Southern California mountains

*Independent Research with the UC San Diego Alpine Club ∣ April 2023, San Bernardino National Forest, CA, USA*

During the record-breaking California snow year of 2022-23 I planned and independent two-day ICESat-2 snow depth ground validation campaign in the backcountry of the San Bernardino mountains, leading a field team of graduate students that I recruited from the [UC San Diego Alpine Club](https://alpineclub.ucsd.edu/).

## Anticipating Rates of Deglaciation in Alaska: Controls on The Mass Loss and Morphology of The Debris Covered Terminus of Kennicott Glacier, Wrangell - St. Elias National Park

*University of Alaska Fairbanks & National Science Foundation ∣ May 2022 - Jun 2022, McCarthy, AK, USA*

During this field project in Summer 2022 I learned how to assemble weather stations in the field and measure ablation rates and meltwater fluxes on mountain glaciers. (Field lead: [Eric Petersen](https://ericivanpetersen.com/))


## United States Antarctic Program: Subglacial Antarctic Lakes Scientific Access (SALSA) project, 2019-20 Geophysics Team

*United States Antarctic Program & National Science Foundation ∣ Oct 2019 - Dec 2019, McMurdo Station / Siple Dome, Antarctica*

A field season on the Siple Coast with the SALSA Antarctica geophysics team gave me an introduction to ground-based Antarctic field work using phase-sensitive radar, GPS stations, fibre-optic distributed temperature sensors and terrestrial laser scanners.
