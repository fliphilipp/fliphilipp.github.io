title: "Rapid Formation of an Ice Doline on Amery Ice Shelf, East Antarctica"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-doline-amery
excerpt: 'Satellite images showed an 11 km2 depression on Amery Ice Shelf as an ice-covered lake drained abruptly in winter 2019 forming an ice doline. ICESat-2 and WorldView data show elevation fell as much as 80 m in the depression, amidst 60 km2 of hydrostatic rebound and uplift over 36 m. ICESat-2 photon data profiled a new meltwater channel, incised when a lake formed by the flexural uplift overflowed into the doline in 2020.'

Surface meltwater accumulating on Antarctic ice shelves can drive fractures through to the ocean and potentially cause their collapse, leading to increased ice discharge from the continent. Implications of increasing surface melt for future ice shelf stability are inadequately understood. The southern Amery Ice Shelf has an extensive surface hydrological system, and we present data from satellite imagery and ICESat‐2 showing a rapid surface disruption there in winter 2019, covering ∼60 km2. We interpret this as an ice‐covered lake draining through the ice shelf, forming an ice doline with a central depression reaching 80 m depth amidst over 36 m uplift. Flexural rebound modeling suggests 0.75 km3 of water was lost. We observed transient refilling of the doline the following summer with rapid incision of a narrow meltwater channel (20 m wide and 6 m deep). This study demonstrates how high‐resolution geodetic measurements can explore critical fine‐scale ice shelf processes.
