I gave a non-technical account of my ski-based ground validation campaign for evaluating the feasibility of space-based snowpack depth measurement with ICESat-2. This was given to private donors who had supported my PhD work, as part of the Scripps Fellowship Luncheon, and included a combination of an oral talk, a poster and a panel discussion.
