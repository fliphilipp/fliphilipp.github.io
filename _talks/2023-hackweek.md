**Learning Objectives**
- Discover some interesting ICESat-2 data by browsing OpenAltimetry
- Get the data into a Jupyter Notebook, plot it and overlay the ground track on a map
- Use Google Earth Engine to find the closest-in-time Sentinel-2 image that is cloud-free along ICESat-2â€™s gound track
- Make a plot from ICESat-2 data and contemporaneous imagery in Jupyter/matplotlib
- Bonus Code: Use Google Earth Engine to extract Sentinel-2 data along the ICESat-2 ground track
