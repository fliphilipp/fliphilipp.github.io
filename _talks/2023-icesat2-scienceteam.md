During the science team meeting of NASA's ICESat-2 satellite altimetry mission, I presented preliminary results from aggregating five years of supraglacial melt lake depth measurements on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. My lightning talk and poster were mostly based on an oral presentation I had given at the WAIS workshop the week before.
