I spent three months supporting Trinity International Residential School near Tirunelveli (Tamil Nadu, India) with ramping up their operations just after the school had opened in this rural part of southern India to allow local kids to receive an internationally accredited education. Duties included teaching several subjects, planning activities outside the classroom and helping out with anything else that needed attention around the school.
