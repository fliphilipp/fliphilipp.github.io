I was the Teaching Assistant for *SIO 115: Ice in the Climate System*, taught by Prof. Helen Fricker during Winter 2020.

My main activities included: 
- introducing students to basic data analysis and plotting in MATLAB
- introducing students to LaTeX, and providing templates for homework submissions
- holding office hours and answering student questions
- grading homeworks and exams, discussing the questions that students had trouble with in class
- helping teach some of the fundamentals of polar/cryospheric science
