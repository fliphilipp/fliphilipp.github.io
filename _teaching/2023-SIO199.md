I supervised two *SIO 199: Independent Research* undergraduate student projects for my advisor Prof. Helen Fricker:
- **"Morphology and Timing of a Recent Calving Event on Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf"**
- **"Characterizing Seasonal Fluctuations in Ice-Marginal Lake Levels in Northwestern Greenland"**

My main duties are providing research direction and technical support for data retrieval, cloud computing and analysis. In particular
- Providing relevant background literature and associated code. 
- Facilitating the formulation of appropriate research questions with the help of additional members of our research group.
- Setting up the students with a cloud-native JupyterHub in AWS for data analysis in Python. 
- Assisting ICESat-2 data retrieval using NSIDC's API.
- Providing sample notebooks for getting started and utility functions for data access and processing. 
- Python / Jupyter troubleshooting.
