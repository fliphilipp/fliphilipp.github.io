I am currently the Teaching Assistant for *SIO 173: Dynamics of the Atmosphere and Climate*, taught by Prof. Nick Lutsko. This class is an introduction to the dynamical principles governing the atmosphere and climate using observations, numerical models, and theory to understand atmospheric circulation, weather systems, severe storms, marine layer, Santa Ana winds, El Ni√±o, climate variability, and other phenomena.
